THE TEAM

-Founded in 2012, ELQANAT FC is a Nigerian based two-dimensional Sporting Enterprise that is owned and run by a crack team of European expatriates with vast 

experience of the Nigerian business terrain.
It was established in  2012 with about 20 players. Today we have a main team of 30 players with 10 additional players in the feeder team in the soccer nursery. The 

club is registered in Nigeria and affiliated to the Nigerian Football Federation (N.F.F).

ELQANAT FC is an influential participant in the NFF league, the   F. A. cup and all N. F. F organized competitions. We have a camp in Ukana, Essien Udim Local 

Government Area, in Akwa  Ibom State, that houses about 35 players. Our goal is to turn ELQANAT FC into the best club sides in Nigeria, cum Africa and the world over, 

within the shortest possible time by discovering and attracting the best youthful players in Nigeria and the west African Coast. Our emphasis is on youth because to 

them belongs the future of the game.
 
Apart from player management, el-QANAT FC is also into sports marketing as we source and secure sponsorship and advert transactions for various Nigerian Club sides, 

national teams and sports associations. We are player agents and scouts.
We also run consultancy and liaison services for Nigerian clubs as well as the organization of sporting events, championships, friendlies, international

transfers, coaching clinics and seminars to update and improve the quality and overall output of local Nigerian coaches.

Although for rather obvious reasons our scope of focus is lop sidedly titled towards football, soccer however, is not our exclusive preserve is we cater for talents in 

Athletics, basketball, boxing, Lawn tennis etc.

Finally, we are a registered and recognized football club as we own and manage the el-QANAT FC.

 
The two-pronged cardinal objective of el-QANAT FC are: - The discovery, grooming and management of the largely untapped and unharnessed excitingly exotic fresh soccer 

talents that is ubiquitous in Nigeria.
In order to effectively actualize this objective therefore we have put together a highly elastic team encapsulating coaches, ex players, scouts, agents and sports 

journalist evenly spread over the vast Nigerian Football zones on the lookout for potential soccer greats.
