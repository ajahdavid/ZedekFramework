Creating your first application follow these steps (Simple as 1-2-3):
======================================================================

Download this repo and extract so you have a folder named "zedek" or what ever else you want to call it in a non web accessible folder (one of the security features of Zedek Framework). You can either download the zip file or easier clone 

	git clone https://github.com/djynnius/ZedekFramework.git

set persmissions to allow reading and writing to zedek folder

Change directory into the public folder and from command line run :

    php -S localhost:8080 zedek.php

on windows replace php with the path to the php binary - example:
	
	c:\xampp\php\php.exe -S localhost:8080 zedek.php


You are done!

You can now view your application on localhost:8080


Hello World!
============

Zedek 3 is built to map urls to engine directories and methods of the class CController (for current controller) in a style:

    http://mysite.com/controller/method/id/?arg1=val1&arg2=val2...$argn=valn

(this mapping is handled primarily by a class named URLMaper) 

No routing files are required.

The MVC is made literal within the engine folder. 

1. To create a new app named foo create a folder with the name foo within the engines folder.
2. within this create a class file "controller.php".
3. within the controller file enter the following code inside your php tags

    <?php
    namespace __zf__;
    class CController extends ZController{
        function bar(){
            print "Hello World";
        }
    }
    

4. Browse to http://mysite.com/foo/bar

and you should see your hello world message!

Congratulations!
